# Biodiversity

**Biodiversity**
- The variety of life on Earth at all its levels and the ecological and evolutionary processes that sustain it.
- Diversity appears to increase an ecosystem’s stability and resilience to disturbance, such as natural disasters and disease. 

## Three main levels of biodiversity 

### genetic diversity
- refers to the variety of genes within an individual and within a population, as well as genetic variation between populations of a given species.
- This variability is the basis of natural selection, as some mutations confer a selective advantage that makes the host organism more likely to survive and reproduce.
    - Example:
    - Excessive hunting for ivory lead to elephant generations with with small or missing tusks.
    - Example on loss genetic diversity:
    - The Irish potato famine. Crops with extremely similar genes are vulnerable to changes in environment or diseases. 
- Lack of genetic diversity can occur because of reductions in population size, when individuals are more likely to reproduce with genetically similar individuals.

- ***genetic drift***
    - Particular variations of genes can disappear by chance during reproduction. If the population is small, this may lead to genetic similar indivduals/organisms which is less able to adapt to changes.
    
- ***location restriction***
    - Some organisms-for example, amphibians, mollusks, and some herbaceous plants—do not travel large distances or disperse their seeds or gametes widely, so their genetic diversity may be mostly restricted to local populations.
    
- ***speciation***
    - Populations of the same species become isolated from one another, either geographically or in terms of their habitat preferences, and stop sharing genetic material with each other, can become different enough that the populations diverge into different species.
    - Example:

    - Caribbean anole lizards. When anole lizards first arrived in Cuba, they competed for resources amongst themselves. Over time, the anoles evolved strategies to divide the tree habitat vertically and were able to coexist. Groups of anoles became specialized to live exclusively in different microhabitats of the trees. The brown anole (Anolis sagrei) lives at the base of the trees near the ground, the Allison’s anole (Anolis allisoni) lives on tree trunks, the Cuban bearded anole (Anolis barbatus) lives between the branches near the top of the tree, and the Cuban knight anole (Anolis equestris) lives in the crown of trees. Over many generations, these populations of anoles became distinct enough—morphologically and genetically—to be considered different species.
- When local populations die out, the genetic diversity they hold is also lost. 

### species diversity
- Species richness: the number of different species in a defined area.
- species evenness: the relative abundance of each species in an area.

### above species-level diversity (including communities, ecosystems, and more)
- depends on the physical characteristics of the environment, the diversity of species present, and the interactions that the species have with each other and with the environment. 
- physical characteristics influence the species and species also modify the physical characterists.
    - Example:
    - Trees can modify their microclimate and the structure and chemical composition of the soil around them, which influences what else can live in that area.
