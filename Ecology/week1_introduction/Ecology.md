# Ecology

**Ecology**
- knowledge concerning the economy of nature.

**Processes of nature**
- biotic interactions:  living organisms interact with each other
- abiotic interactions: physical and chemical components which interact with the environment

**Ecological hierarchy (from bottom up)**
- Indivdual - Population - Community - Ecosystem - Biosphere

**Interactions at organism level**
- Study of individual organisms and their adaptations to specific habitats and conditions
    - Example:
    - In Gorongosa National Park, scientists study bats and how they use echolocation to find their prey in the darkness and how the prey (moths) are adapted to avoid the bats.
    
**Interactions at population level**
- The term “population” describes a group of individuals of one species living in the same area at the same time.
- defination of a population depends on what question the ecologist asks or what approach they use
    - Example: 
    - defination based on genetic criteria, or geographic boundaries, or behavioral interactions
- study of how and why the numbers of individuals of a species change over time
    - Example:
    - How many zebras need to be introduced to Gorongosa National Park in order to ensure genetic diversity?
    - What is the maximum number of waterbuck that can live in Gorongosa National Park?
    
**Interactions at community level**
- Communities are assemblages of populations of different species that inhabit the same place at the same time.
- study of the connections among groups of species (e.g., predation, herbivory, competition, mutualism, parasitism) and how these interactions affect community structure and the diversity and relative abundances of species.
    - Example:
    -  How can so many species of birds inhabit the same tropical rain forest on Mount Gorongosa? 
    
**Interactions at ecosystem level**
- In 1935, Tansley coined the term “ecosystem,” meaning an ecological system, to assert the importance of incorporating the movements of energy and materials into the study of ecology.
- study of the interactions of organisms within a community and with their physical environment as an integrated system—an ecosystem.

**Interactions at golbal level**
- study of how global patterns and dynamics (e.g., ocean and wind currents, natural variations in seasons such as El Niño, plate tectonics, climate change) are responsible for the geographic distribution and abundances of populations as well as the functioning and productivity of ecosystems.
- Questions in global ecology focus on interactions among the Earth’s ecosystems, land, oceans, and atmosphere.
    - Example:
    - How does ocean circulation affect the global distribution of coral reefs?
