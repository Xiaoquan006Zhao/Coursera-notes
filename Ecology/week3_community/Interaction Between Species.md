# Interaction Between Species
- Complexity of the various interactions
  - Alter one relation may cause other species(outside of the relation) to interact differently
    - A negative relation for a species may have worst interaction in a new relationship
- Interspecific interactions
  - Competition
    - -/- Negative interaction for both species in a competition relationship
    - Different species compete for resourses necessary for growth and/or survival
    - A little advantage for one species will outcompete others in a long run (competitive exclusion)
    - The existing species is a result of Natural Selection, similar species will differ a little in their niche in order to all survive (niche differentiation and resource partitioning)
  - Predation/Herbivory
    - +/- Positive interaction for the predator and negative interaction for the prey
    - Due to Natural Selection, predators and preys have different adoptations to help them survive
      - Predators have adaptations such as teeth, claws, stingers, or poison
      - Herbivores have specialized teeth or digestive systems that are effective at breaking down the cellulose found in many plant species
      - Preys have adaptations such as hiding, fleeing, forming herds, giving alarm calls, mechanical or chemical defenses
    - Coevolution, the species that evloves efficient will survive
  - Parasitism
    - +/- Positive interaction for the parasite and negative interaction for the host
    - Symbiosis, parasite uses host's nourishment
    - Parasite alters host's survival, reproduction, and/or the density of their populations
    - Some parasite manipulate host's behavior
  - Mutualism
    - +/+ Positive interaction for both species in a mutualism relationship
    - This is a more specific relationship as each interaction tends to be different
    - Able to survive alone but works well together
      - Ants protect Acacia trees from browsing herbivores by swarming and stinging the animals, and feed on the tree’s nectar
    - Obligate mutualism, can not survive alone
      - Termites can not digest their food (wood) without the enzymes produced by the microorganisms in their digestive system
    - Mutualism may also involve adaptations that affect the survival, reproduction, or dispersal of the other species
      - Many animals have adaptations that help them to either find (with a heightened sense of smell) or consume the fruit or nectar (hummingbird's beak)
  - Commensalism
    - +/0 Positive interaction for one of the species and no net effect for the other
    - It can be tricky as net effect is hard to determine
    - “hitchhiking” species
      - Plants use animals to transfer seeds to other places. Add weights to the animal but also provide a camouflaging benefit?
  - Ammensalism
    - -/0 Negative interaction for one of the species and no net effect for the other
    - Animals walking through plantations. No effct on the animals? but harmful for the plantations
