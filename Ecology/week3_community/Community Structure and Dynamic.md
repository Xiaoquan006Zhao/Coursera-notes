# Community Structure and Dynamics
- Bottom-up and Top-down controls
  - Bottom-up
    - Lower trophic levels influence higher trophic levels
  - Top-down
    - Higher trophic levels influence lower trophic levels
- Species with large effects
  - Keystone Species
    - Trophic cascade
    - Increase or decrease the population of keystone species will influence other species in the system significantly
    - Abiotic changes such as enviornment change can also influence other species to a point that the system can not function. The two can happen at the same time.
      - Slat marsh, the drought increase the salinity which decrease plant population and making the habitat unsuitable for top predators which increase grazer population which further derease plant population.  
  - Abundant Species
    - Species become abundant by avoiding predation, surviving disease, outcompeting competitors
    - Added effect will shape the system they are in 
  - Ecosystem Engineers
    - Species that alter, maintain, destory the enviornment they are in
      - Corals build reefs
      - Beavers build dams
      - The effect can be positive or negative depends on other species living in the same system
