# Population Dynamics
- A population is a group of individuals of one species living in the same area at the same time.

## Five basic components underlie population dynamics:
- birth, death, sex ratio, age structure, dispersal

### birth and death
- birth rate and death rate determines if a population increases or decreases. 

**density/population dependent factors**
- Example:
- Increase in population reduces population size. Imaging an area with limited resources where individuals are competing with eachother. Individuals 
who do not have access to enough resources would decease (increase in death rate) or fail to reproduce (decrease in birth rate). So, the whole population size 
will decrease.
- Example:
- Decease in population reduces population size: Imageing a population with very small population that are living in a constrained habitat. If the population size
is too small, then individuals are more prone to predators. Thus, lead to an increase in death rate.

**density/population independent fators**
- Apart from factors discussed above, there are density independent factors like natural disasters. 
- Diseases can be an independent factor as well. But a larger population can be more responsive to such change, if the biodiversity present in this population is 
sufficient enough.

### sex ratio
- Generally speaking, a small number of females is more likely to limit growth. Because a male individual can fertilize many females.
- poaching and hunting can cause a skewed sex ratio:
    - demand for male ornaments
    - more vulnerable female targets
- Imbalanced sex ratio can cause delayed mating and sometimes failure to mate and reproduce. Possibly a more dangerous situation (weather, predators, resources) 
for offsprings. 
- Example:
- As an offspring born in dry seanson would have less access to water compare to if it was born in rainy season. 

### Age structure
- Age structure refers to the composition of older versus younger individuals in a population.
- Not all individuals can reproduce in a population. Young juveniles and old individuals that are infertile can not contribute to birth rate. 
- Age structure is different for differnt species. Many short-lived plants and animals reach sexual maturity in their first year and rarely 
deviate from this pattern. In contrast, longer-lived species (including species of albatrosses, tortoises, and trees) often delay maturation 
for many years, using energy early on for growth rather than reproduction.

### Dispersal
- Dispersal is defined as the movement of individuals from one population (emigration) to another (immigration).
- In animals, dispersal usually occurs in juveniles (solitary individuals just prior to first reproduction).
- In plant, dispersal is a more diverse process, which can involve pollen and seeds and is mediated most frequently by wind or animals.
- Dispersal can prevent inbreeding between closely related individuals and expand habitat. Thus, increases the chance for the population to persist. 

**Metapopulations**
- A metapopulation is a group of subpopulations that are separated by inhospitable terrain but linked when individuals occasionally move between them and reproduce.

### Survivorship
- Survivorship refers to the fraction of individuals that lives up to a certain age (versus survival rate, which is the probability of 
an individual surviving a given unit of time).
