# Flow of energy and matter

## Energy
- Energy comes in the form of solar radiation, used by autotrophs to build organic compounds and then passed to heterotrophs then dissipated as heat.

## Matter
- Chemical elements are mostly recycled, but smaller amounts also flow in and out of an ecosystemâ€™s boundaries over time.
- Autotrophic organisms assimilate inorganic chemical elements from the air, soil, and/or water, and transform them into organic form by incorporating them into their biomass.
- Detritivores and decomposers break down organic wastes (e.g., remains of dead organisms, excrement, fallen foliage) and return them to the environment in inorganic form.
